Damn Small Scripting Language

I created this scripting language when I couldn't find another solution at the time in Visual Studio .NET.
I designed this so I could implement it's functions directly into my game code.

Since it was ported to C#, I haven't had the chance to test out every function. So it might have some ground breaking bugs.
It featured libraries, external code (talking back to the host application.)
It featured compiling and linking code. Which enabled it to run faster.

Since it was created in VB, it's syntax resembles VB.
